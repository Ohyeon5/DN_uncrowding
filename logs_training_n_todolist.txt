TRAINING LOG


TODOLIST
1. Retrain and retest the known normalizations
 - batch norm, group norm, instance norm, layer norm, and style norm
2. Try style norm and restitution one
3. Maybe change the training scheme 
 - How about also using soft labels??? (sq-st-sq-st-sq: (sq,st)=(3/5,2/5))
   => Because, otherwise, interpretations will be exactly as same as Capsnet
4. Toy-model, then to ResNet (or other pretrained models), to get some inductive bias already..
